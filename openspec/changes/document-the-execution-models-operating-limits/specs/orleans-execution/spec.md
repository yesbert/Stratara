## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: An accepted command is recorded before the call returns and resumed after a crash

Where a host has registered the Orleans execution model's command dispatcher, dispatching a command
SHALL record it durably before the dispatch returns and hand it to its activation afterwards. The
record SHALL be committed on its own, not with anything the caller writes in its own unit of work,
so that a caller whose own save fails after the dispatch still has a recorded command that runs, and
the documentation SHALL say so where it introduces the record. A
host that dies between acceptance and completion SHALL resume the command after a configurable
grace. A command whose completion the host had not recorded before it died SHALL run again. A command
whose handler keeps failing SHALL be resumed a bounded number of times and then kept for an operator,
as a bus message a handler cannot take is kept, and SHALL NOT hold back the resumption of other
commands; an operator SHALL be able to return a kept command, which is then resumed with its attempts
starting over. Every attempt that fails SHALL be logged with the command's identity, the aggregate it
names and its type, and so SHALL a hand-over that fails, so that a failing handler is seen before the
command is kept; the resumption that follows SHALL log the attempt number. A command whose handler is still running SHALL NOT be handed over
again, however long it runs and whether or not the handler yields, and a heavy command waiting for a
worker or a permit SHALL count as running. A resumed command SHALL keep the order of the aggregate
it names whatever protection its payload carries. Heavy commands SHALL be exempt from both order
promises, and a heavy command SHALL NOT hold back a command or a resumption that follows it. The
commands waiting in an aggregate's order SHALL run to the end however long the order takes; the
runtime's response timeout bounds a caller's wait for one forwarded command, and the documentation
SHALL name it as a setting the host sizes. A forwarded command whose handler outlasts that timeout
SHALL be reported to its caller as timed out while its handler runs to the end and its append commits;
the documentation SHALL state this and SHALL say that a caller does not retry on a timeout, because
the retry would run the command a second time. Recorded commands SHALL be resumed by the
execution model's drain wherever that drain runs with an intent store registered, whichever host
dispatched them, SHALL never be published to a message bus, and a drain that finds recorded commands
without an intent store SHALL report it.

Every command on this path SHALL pass through the same mediator pipeline — validation, authorization,
tenant isolation, audit — as a command on the bus path, and an enqueue-time authorization the host
registered SHALL apply whatever order it and the execution model were registered in. A resumed command
SHALL run under the session recorded with it, on a silo and without the request that dispatched it, so
an authorization the host registers SHALL be answered from that session; the documentation SHALL say
that a provider which answers from the current web request refuses every resumed command, which is
then kept after its attempts, and SHALL name a session-driven provider as the shape this path needs.

#### Scenario: The host dies after acceptance

- **WHEN** the dispatch has returned and the host is killed before the handler ran
- **THEN** the command runs after the host or another silo resumes it — verified with twenty kills
  on the PostgreSQL store

#### Scenario: The host dies after the handler completed

- **WHEN** the handler completed and the host is killed before the completion was recorded
- **THEN** the command runs a second time, which the handler tolerates as it does under at-least-once
  delivery on the bus

#### Scenario: A handler keeps failing

- **WHEN** a resumed command's handler throws on every attempt
- **THEN** each attempt is logged with the command's identity and each resumption with its attempt
  number, it is resumed up to the configured bound, then kept with the attempt count and the last
  failure, and the commands after it are still resumed

#### Scenario: An operator returns a kept command

- **WHEN** an operator returns a kept command through the documented procedure
- **THEN** it is resumed with its attempt count starting over

#### Scenario: A handler runs longer than the grace

- **WHEN** a recorded command's handler is still running after the grace has passed
- **THEN** it is not handed over again while it runs, and it runs once

#### Scenario: A heavy handler computes past the grace without yielding

- **WHEN** a heavy command's handler runs longer than the grace without awaiting anything
- **THEN** it is not handed over again while it runs, it runs once, and its permit is still held when
  it ends

#### Scenario: A heavy burst queues commands longer than the grace

- **WHEN** more heavy commands are dispatched than the pool runs at once, so that a command waits for a
  worker longer than the grace
- **THEN** every command runs exactly once

#### Scenario: An aggregate's order takes longer than the response timeout

- **WHEN** commands accepted into one aggregate's order take longer to run, together, than the
  runtime's response timeout
- **THEN** every accepted command runs, in order, and none is failed back to its caller as not having
  run

#### Scenario: A forwarded command's handler outlasts the response timeout

- **WHEN** a command that names an aggregate is dispatched through the mediator and its handler runs
  longer than the runtime's response timeout
- **THEN** the caller observes a timeout, the handler runs once to the end, its append is committed,
  and the operations documentation says that a caller does not retry on a timeout — verified with a
  shortened response timeout on the PostgreSQL store

#### Scenario: A caller's own unit of work fails after the dispatch

- **WHEN** a caller dispatches a command through the recording dispatcher inside a unit of work of its
  own and that unit of work is then abandoned without a save
- **THEN** the command is recorded and runs, because the record was committed on its own — verified on
  the PostgreSQL store

#### Scenario: A resumed command is authorized from its recorded session

- **WHEN** a host registers an authorization provider that answers from the session context, dispatches
  a role-guarded command that the dispatching session is entitled to, and is killed before the handler
  ran
- **THEN** the resumed command is authorized on the silo as it was at dispatch and its handler runs;
  and where the host's provider answers from the current web request instead, every resumed command is
  refused and kept after its attempts, as the documentation says — verified on the PostgreSQL store

#### Scenario: A resumed command's payload is encrypted

- **WHEN** a command whose payload is encrypted is resumed after a crash
- **THEN** it runs in the activation of the aggregate it names, after the commands before it

#### Scenario: A command the host's pipeline rejects is dispatched

- **WHEN** a command that the host's validation or authorization rejects is dispatched on this path
- **THEN** it is rejected as it would be on the bus path, and its handler does not run

#### Scenario: Enqueue-time authorization is registered after the execution model

- **WHEN** a host registers enqueue-time authorization before or after the execution model's dispatcher
- **THEN** an unauthorised dispatch is refused and an authorised one reaches its activation, in both
  orders

#### Scenario: Two commands to one aggregate from one scope

- **WHEN** one scope dispatches two commands naming the same aggregate, one after the other
- **THEN** they run in the order they were dispatched; across scopes no order is promised, and a
  heavy command keeps no order with the commands around it

#### Scenario: The drain runs on a silo that did not dispatch the commands

- **WHEN** commands are recorded by an API host and the drain runs on a silo where the execution
  model's dispatcher is not registered, and a recorded command is due or kept
- **THEN** the due command is resumed within its attempt bound, the kept command stays kept, and
  neither is published to a bus

#### Scenario: Two heavy commands to one aggregate are due

- **WHEN** two heavy commands naming the same aggregate are due in one resumption, and further
  commands are due after them
- **THEN** every due command is handed over without waiting for either heavy command to finish

### Requirement: Projections and sagas read the store in commit order and never miss a committed fact

Where a host has registered the Orleans execution model for projections or sagas, each SHALL read
the event store from a checkpoint, in an order in which no entry at or below a checkpoint can still
commit later, and apply what it reads under the session recorded with each entry. A commit SHALL
wake the readers of the partitions it touched; a wake-up that is lost costs latency and never a
fact, because a poll reads the store regardless. A committed fact SHALL reach every projection and
saga whatever dies after the commit. Two rebuilds of one projection SHALL NOT interleave: the
projection's readers SHALL resume only when every rebuild that paused them has finished, and a
rebuild requested while a full replay is active SHALL be refused with a message that says so. A full
replay on a host whose projections read the store SHALL return every such projection's checkpoint to
the beginning before the read models are emptied, and the replay's own pass over the store SHALL be
followed by the readers' pass from the beginning once the replay ends, so that every store-reading
projection applies the store twice under a full replay and is correct because it applies idempotently;
the documentation SHALL say so where it describes the full replay and SHALL name the rebuild of a
single projection as the way to re-read a read model once.

#### Scenario: The host dies between the commit and the wake-up

- **WHEN** a host is killed after committing events and before any wake-up or publication
- **THEN** every projection and saga applies those events after the host or another silo reads the
  store — verified with twenty kills on the PostgreSQL store, none lost

#### Scenario: Two transactions commit out of sequence order

- **WHEN** a transaction with the lower sequence number commits after one with a higher one
- **THEN** no reader skips the late committer — verified on the PostgreSQL store with the native
  reader and on any relational store with the portable reader

#### Scenario: A projection is rebuilt

- **WHEN** a rebuildable projection is asked to rebuild
- **THEN** only its read model is emptied and re-read from the beginning of the store, in parallel
  over the partitions, while every other projection keeps applying live events

#### Scenario: A rebuild fails part-way

- **WHEN** emptying a rebuildable projection's read model fails part-way through a rebuild
- **THEN** the projection re-reads from the beginning of the store when it resumes, and never applies
  on top of a partly emptied read model without re-reading

#### Scenario: A projection is asked to rebuild twice at once

- **WHEN** a second rebuild of a projection is requested while the first is still emptying its read
  model
- **THEN** the projection's readers do not resume until both have finished, and the read model holds
  every fact of the store once the readers have caught up

#### Scenario: A rebuild is requested during a full replay

- **WHEN** a projection's rebuild is requested while a full replay is active
- **THEN** the rebuild is refused with a message naming the replay, and the replay is not disturbed

#### Scenario: A full replay runs on a host whose projections read the store

- **WHEN** a full replay is requested on a host whose projections read the store
- **THEN** every store-reading projection's checkpoint is at the beginning when its read model is
  emptied, its read model holds every fact once the readers have caught up after the replay, and a
  projection that counts its applications has applied each fact twice — verified on the PostgreSQL
  store with the native reader

### Requirement: Work that must happen once happens once per cluster

Singleton work SHALL run in one place in the cluster at its period, without a lock, only on a silo
that registered it, and SHALL resume elsewhere when the silo running it is lost. Where the cluster
declares a silo dead that is still running, the work MAY run on a second silo from that declaration
until the declared silo learns of it and stops, so a consumer's singleton work SHALL tolerate a run
overlapping with one on another host, as the framework's own outbox drain does; the documentation
SHALL state that window and SHALL name how long a failover takes in terms of the cluster's membership
settings and the work's keep-alive period. Owner-checked durable
timers SHALL fire once per cluster on or after their due time, SHALL fire for an owner that exists and
never for one that was removed, and SHALL survive a restart of the silo that registered them. A timer
SHALL NOT fire a further period late because the clocks of the silos differ slightly. A process
timeout registered in a step SHALL survive a kill at any point of that step, and a timeout whose
handling cancels or registers the process's timers SHALL complete.

#### Scenario: Two silos run the same singleton work

- **WHEN** two silos register the same singleton work
- **THEN** it runs once per period in the cluster, not once per silo

#### Scenario: A timer's owner was removed before it was due

- **WHEN** a timer is due and its owner no longer exists
- **THEN** the timer unregisters itself and no handler runs

#### Scenario: The silo is killed with timers open

- **WHEN** a silo is killed with registered timers and restarted
- **THEN** every kept owner's timer fires exactly once and no removed owner's timer fires — verified
  with ten kills on the PostgreSQL reminder table

#### Scenario: Silos register different singleton work

- **WHEN** one silo registers a singleton work and another silo of the cluster does not
- **THEN** the work runs on the silo that registered it, and the other silo reports no failure for it

#### Scenario: The silo running singleton work is lost

- **WHEN** the silo running a singleton work is killed while another silo that registered it stays
- **THEN** the work runs on the remaining silo at its period

#### Scenario: The silo running singleton work is declared dead while it still runs

- **WHEN** the cluster declares dead a silo that is still running a singleton work, because its probes
  went unanswered
- **THEN** the work is brought up on another silo that registered it, both MAY run until the declared
  silo has stopped itself, and the operations documentation names that window and the settings that
  bound the failover — the membership probe settings, the reminder refresh and the keep-alive period

#### Scenario: A timeout changes the process's timers

- **WHEN** a process handles a timeout by cancelling or registering timers, or a fact for the process
  arrives while its timeout is being handled
- **THEN** the handling completes and the timeout does not run again

#### Scenario: The host dies inside a step that schedules a timeout

- **WHEN** a silo is killed at any point of a step that schedules a timeout, and the fact is applied
  again after the restart
- **THEN** the timeout fires once, and a timeout for a step whose events were never recorded reaches the
  process with the state as recorded

#### Scenario: A tick arrives shortly before the due time

- **WHEN** a timer's tick runs on a silo whose clock is slightly behind the registering host's
- **THEN** the timer fires on that tick and not a retry period later

#### Scenario: A timer's handler runs longer than the retry period

- **WHEN** a timer's handler is still running when the timer's next tick arrives
- **THEN** the tick does not start the handler again, and the handler runs once

### Requirement: The execution model can be adopted per role beside the bus workers

Each role — commands, projections, sagas, outbox drain, timers, heavy work — SHALL be adopted with
one registration after the role's existing composite, and a host SHALL be able to run both models
at once during a rollout, because both apply idempotently. A host that asks the projection or saga
registration to keep publishing bundles to the bus SHALL keep the bus dispatcher it registered
whatever the shape of that registration, and a host that asks for it without having registered a
bus dispatcher SHALL fail at registration with a message naming what is missing rather than run
without publishing. A role's work SHALL run only on a silo
that registered the role: a cluster whose silos register different roles SHALL place each
aggregate, projection, saga, timer owner and heavy unit on a silo that registered its role, and a
call for a role no silo of the cluster registered SHALL fail with a message naming the role rather
than activate where the role is missing. A host that only dispatches commands MAY join the cluster
as a client rather than a silo. A host that registers the execution model
without the storage-backed grain directory it requires SHALL fail at start with a message naming
what is missing, not at the first activation, and so SHALL a host with an invalid setting, naming the
setting. The host's own timer owners and handlers SHALL be honoured whatever order they are registered
in relative to the execution model.

#### Scenario: A host adopts the projection role

- **WHEN** a host calls the projection services composite and then the execution model's projection
  registration
- **THEN** the bus-fed projection worker is not registered and the store-reading projections are

#### Scenario: A host keeps the bus beside the grains with a dispatcher registered by a factory

- **WHEN** a host registers its bus bundle dispatcher through a factory or an instance and then asks
  the projection registration to keep publishing to the bus
- **THEN** a committed bundle still reaches the bus dispatcher, and the store-reading grains are woken

#### Scenario: A host asks to keep the bus without a bus dispatcher

- **WHEN** a host asks the projection or saga registration to keep publishing to the bus while no bus
  bundle dispatcher is registered
- **THEN** the registration fails with a message naming the parameter and the registration that
  supplies a bus dispatcher

#### Scenario: Silos register different roles

- **WHEN** one silo of a cluster registers the command role and another the projection, saga and
  timer roles, and commands are dispatched, facts committed and timers registered
- **THEN** every command runs on the command silo, every projection, saga and timer owner runs on the
  other, and no call fails for a role missing on the silo it ran on

#### Scenario: No silo registers a role

- **WHEN** a command is dispatched to a cluster in which no silo registered the command role
- **THEN** the dispatch fails with a message naming the command role, and no activation is left
  behind on a silo that lacks it

#### Scenario: The API host joins as a client

- **WHEN** a host registers the execution model's command dispatcher and joins the cluster as an
  Orleans client, not a silo
- **THEN** its dispatches are recorded and run on a silo that registered the command role

#### Scenario: A host forgets the directory

- **WHEN** a host registers the execution model but no storage-backed grain directory under the
  name the model selects
- **THEN** the silo fails to start with a message that names the missing registration

#### Scenario: A host configures an invalid setting

- **WHEN** a host configures a non-positive batch size, limit or partition count, or a period below the
  runtime's minimum
- **THEN** the host fails at start with a message that names the setting

#### Scenario: A host registers its timer owners after the execution model

- **WHEN** a host registers its own timer owners and handlers after the execution model's registrations
- **THEN** its timers fire for its owners, and stateful processes' timeouts still fire
