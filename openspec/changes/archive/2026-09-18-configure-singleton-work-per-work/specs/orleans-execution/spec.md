## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Work that must happen once happens once per cluster

Singleton work SHALL run in one place in the cluster at its period, without a lock, only on a silo
that registered it, and SHALL resume elsewhere when the silo running it is lost. Where the cluster
declares a silo dead that is still running, the work MAY run on a second silo from that declaration
until the declared silo learns of it and stops, so a consumer's singleton work SHALL tolerate a run
overlapping with one on another host, as the framework's own outbox drain does; the documentation
SHALL state that window, SHALL name how long a failover takes in terms of the cluster's membership
settings and the work's keep-alive period, and SHALL say that the window is bounded by those settings
only while the declared silo can still read the cluster's membership — one that cannot never learns of
its declaration. A run that fails SHALL be logged whatever it failed with,
including a cancellation the work was not asked for, except where the silo it runs on is stopping. Two works SHALL NOT carry one name: the name is what a work's single run is keyed by, so the second would
never run, and a host that registers two SHALL fail rather than run one of them. Settings given with a
work's registration SHALL apply to that work alone; settings the host configures for singleton work as
a whole SHALL apply to every work whose registration does not set them; and a work registered twice
SHALL run with the settings of its later registration, once. Owner-checked durable
timers SHALL fire once per cluster on or after their due time, SHALL fire for an owner that exists and
never for one that was removed, and SHALL survive a restart of the silo that registered them. A timer
SHALL NOT fire a further period late because the clocks of the silos differ slightly. A process
timeout registered in a step SHALL survive a kill at any point of that step, and a timeout whose
handling cancels or registers the process's timers SHALL complete.

A timer's handler SHALL receive a cancellation token that is requested when the silo running it
stops and the handler has not completed within the runtime's deactivation budget; a timer whose
handler stops on that token SHALL stay registered and fire on the next silo, which is the at-least-once
delivery the timers promise, and the stop SHALL be logged with the owner and the purpose. A timer
registered for an owner and purpose while a tick for that owner and purpose is being handled SHALL be
kept and SHALL fire, whether or not its due time is the one being handled. An owner id longer than
the timer store holds SHALL be refused on registration, cancellation and listing with a message
naming the limit and the length given, as a purpose is, so that the refusal is seen at the
registration and not at the first tick.

A run of a singleton work that fails SHALL be logged with an event of the framework's own, naming the
work and carrying the failure, and SHALL NOT stop the work: the next run goes ahead at its period. A
singleton work registered with the name it publishes under SHALL NOT be constructed before the silo
is active, so that a work whose construction needs the running host is not constructed while the
silo starts; a work whose name differs from the one it was registered with SHALL fail the silo's
start with a message naming both.

#### Scenario: Two singleton works carry one name

- **WHEN** a host registers two works under the same name, or two registered works return the same name
- **THEN** the host fails naming both works and the name, rather than running one of them

#### Scenario: Two silos run the same singleton work

- **WHEN** two silos register the same singleton work
- **THEN** it runs once per period in the cluster, not once per silo

#### Scenario: A timer's owner was removed before it was due

- **WHEN** a timer is due and its owner no longer exists
- **THEN** the timer unregisters itself and no handler runs

#### Scenario: The silo is killed with timers open

- **WHEN** a silo is killed with registered timers and restarted
- **THEN** every kept owner's timer fires exactly once and no removed owner's timer fires — verified
  with ten kills on the PostgreSQL reminder table

#### Scenario: Silos register different singleton work

- **WHEN** one silo registers a singleton work and another silo of the cluster does not
- **THEN** the work runs on the silo that registered it, and the other silo reports no failure for it

#### Scenario: The silo running singleton work is lost

- **WHEN** the silo running a singleton work is killed while another silo that registered it stays
- **THEN** the work runs on the remaining silo at its period

#### Scenario: The silo running singleton work is declared dead while it still runs

- **WHEN** the cluster declares dead a silo that is still running a singleton work, because its probes
  went unanswered
- **THEN** the work is brought up on another silo that registered it, both MAY run until the declared
  silo has stopped itself, and the operations documentation names that window and the settings that
  bound the failover — the membership probe settings, the reminder refresh and the keep-alive period

#### Scenario: A timeout changes the process's timers

- **WHEN** a process handles a timeout by cancelling or registering timers, or a fact for the process
  arrives while its timeout is being handled
- **THEN** the handling completes and the timeout does not run again

#### Scenario: The host dies inside a step that schedules a timeout

- **WHEN** a silo is killed at any point of a step that schedules a timeout, and the fact is applied
  again after the restart
- **THEN** the timeout fires once, and a timeout for a step whose events were never recorded reaches the
  process with the state as recorded

#### Scenario: A tick arrives shortly before the due time

- **WHEN** a timer's tick runs on a silo whose clock is slightly behind the registering host's
- **THEN** the timer fires on that tick and not a retry period later

#### Scenario: A timer's handler runs longer than the retry period

- **WHEN** a timer's handler is still running when the timer's next tick arrives
- **THEN** the tick does not start the handler again, and the handler runs once

#### Scenario: A silo stops while a timer's handler runs

- **WHEN** a silo is stopped while a timer's handler is waiting on its cancellation token, and the
  timer's owner still exists
- **THEN** the handler observes the cancellation within the deactivation budget, the stop is logged
  with the owner and the purpose, the timer is still registered, and it fires on the next silo that
  serves the owner — verified on the PostgreSQL reminder table

#### Scenario: A timer is re-registered from its own handler with the same due time

- **WHEN** a timer's handler registers a timer for the same owner and purpose with the same due time
  and returns
- **THEN** the timer is still registered when the handler has returned, and it fires again within a
  retry period

#### Scenario: A timer is re-registered from its own handler with a later due time

- **WHEN** a timer's handler registers a timer for the same owner and purpose with a later due time
  and returns
- **THEN** only the later timer is registered when the handler has returned, and it fires at its due
  time

#### Scenario: An owner id is longer than the timer store holds

- **WHEN** a timer is registered, cancelled or listed for an owner id longer than the timer store
  holds
- **THEN** the call is refused with a message naming the limit and the length given, and nothing is
  registered

#### Scenario: A singleton work's run fails

- **WHEN** a run of a singleton work throws
- **THEN** an event of the framework's names the work and carries the failure, and the work runs again
  at its next period

#### Scenario: A work is registered with its name

- **WHEN** a host registers a singleton work with the name it publishes under, and the work's
  constructor records when it runs
- **THEN** the work is not constructed before the silo is active, and it runs once per period on the
  silo as any other

#### Scenario: A work's name differs from the registered one

- **WHEN** a host registers a singleton work under a name that is not the work's `Name`
- **THEN** the silo fails at start with a message naming both

#### Scenario: Two works are registered with different keep-alive periods

- **WHEN** a host registers one singleton work with a keep-alive period of two minutes and another with
  five
- **THEN** the first is kept alive every two minutes and the second every five

#### Scenario: A work is registered twice with different settings

- **WHEN** a host registers the same singleton work twice, each time with a different keep-alive period
- **THEN** the work runs once, with the period of the later registration
