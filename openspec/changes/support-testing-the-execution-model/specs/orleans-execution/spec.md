## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The execution model can be adopted per role beside the bus workers

Each role — commands, projections, sagas, outbox drain, timers, heavy work — SHALL be adopted with
one registration after the role's existing composite, and a host SHALL be able to run both models
at once during a rollout, because both apply idempotently. A role's work SHALL run only on a silo
that registered the role: a cluster whose silos register different roles SHALL place each
aggregate, projection, saga, timer owner and heavy unit on a silo that registered its role, and a
call for a role no silo of the cluster registered SHALL fail with a message naming the role rather
than activate where the role is missing. A host that only dispatches commands MAY join the cluster
as a client rather than a silo. A host that registers the execution model
without the storage-backed grain directory it requires SHALL fail at start with a message naming
what is missing, not at the first activation, and so SHALL a host with an invalid setting, naming the
setting. The host's own timer owners and handlers SHALL be honoured whatever order they are registered
in relative to the execution model. The documentation SHALL show how a consumer tests its handlers,
projections, sagas and timers on the execution model in one process, with the registrations it uses
in production, and SHALL ship a runnable sample that does so.

#### Scenario: A host adopts the projection role

- **WHEN** a host calls the projection services composite and then the execution model's projection
  registration
- **THEN** the bus-fed projection worker is not registered and the store-reading projections are

#### Scenario: Silos register different roles

- **WHEN** one silo of a cluster registers the command role and another the projection, saga and
  timer roles, and commands are dispatched, facts committed and timers registered
- **THEN** every command runs on the command silo, every projection, saga and timer owner runs on the
  other, and no call fails for a role missing on the silo it ran on

#### Scenario: No silo registers a role

- **WHEN** a command is dispatched to a cluster in which no silo registered the command role
- **THEN** the dispatch fails with a message naming the command role, and no activation is left
  behind on a silo that lacks it

#### Scenario: The API host joins as a client

- **WHEN** a host registers the execution model's command dispatcher and joins the cluster as an
  Orleans client, not a silo
- **THEN** its dispatches are recorded and run on a silo that registered the command role

#### Scenario: A host forgets the directory

- **WHEN** a host registers the execution model but no storage-backed grain directory under the
  name the model selects
- **THEN** the silo fails to start with a message that names the missing registration

#### Scenario: A host configures an invalid setting

- **WHEN** a host configures a non-positive batch size, limit or partition count, or a period below the
  runtime's minimum
- **THEN** the host fails at start with a message that names the setting

#### Scenario: A host registers its timer owners after the execution model

- **WHEN** a host registers its own timer owners and handlers after the execution model's registrations
- **THEN** its timers fire for its owners, and stateful processes' timeouts still fire

#### Scenario: A consumer tests on the execution model

- **WHEN** a consumer follows the testing documentation for the execution model
- **THEN** its handlers, projections, sagas and timers run through the registrations it uses in
  production, in the test's process, without a cluster, a broker or a database server — and the
  shipped sample runs the same in one console run
