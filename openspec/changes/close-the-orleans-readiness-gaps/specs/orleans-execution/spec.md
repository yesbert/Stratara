## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: One aggregate has one writer across the cluster

Where a host has registered the Orleans execution model for commands, a command that names an
aggregate SHALL run in that aggregate's activation, and two commands naming the same aggregate SHALL
NOT run concurrently anywhere in the cluster. Where an unstable cluster produces a second activation regardless, the
store's version constraint SHALL still refuse the second writer, so the guarantee degrades to the one
the bus workers give and never below it. A command that a handler sends for another aggregate SHALL
run in that other aggregate's activation, not in the sending handler's.

A heavy command SHALL be the exception: it SHALL run in the bounded heavy-work pool, outside its
aggregate's activation, so that a long unit does not hold the aggregate's other commands back. It MAY
therefore run while another command naming the same aggregate runs; where both append, the store's
version constraint SHALL refuse the later writer, and the refused command SHALL be resumed like any
failing command — the guarantee the bus path gives heavy work.

#### Scenario: Two commands name one aggregate from two hosts

- **WHEN** two hosts dispatch commands naming the same aggregate at the same time
- **THEN** one runs after the other, in one activation, and no concurrency conflict is raised

#### Scenario: The cluster is unstable and activates an aggregate twice

- **WHEN** a directory lapse lets two activations of one aggregate exist
- **THEN** at most one of their appends succeeds and the other observes a concurrency conflict, as it
  would on the bus path

#### Scenario: A handler sends a command for another aggregate

- **WHEN** a handler running for one aggregate dispatches a command naming a second aggregate while a
  command for the second aggregate is running
- **THEN** the dispatched command runs after the running one, in the second aggregate's activation

#### Scenario: A heavy command and a command name one aggregate

- **WHEN** a heavy command naming an aggregate runs and a command naming the same aggregate is
  dispatched
- **THEN** the command runs without waiting for the heavy command, and if both append, one append
  succeeds and the other command observes a concurrency conflict and is resumed

### Requirement: An accepted command is recorded before the call returns and resumed after a crash

Where a host has registered the Orleans execution model's command dispatcher, dispatching a command
SHALL record it durably before the dispatch returns and hand it to its activation afterwards. A
host that dies between acceptance and completion SHALL resume the command after a configurable
grace. A command whose completion the host had not recorded before it died SHALL run again. A command
whose handler keeps failing SHALL be resumed a bounded number of times and then kept for an operator,
as a bus message a handler cannot take is kept, and SHALL NOT hold back the resumption of other
commands; an operator SHALL be able to return a kept command, which is then resumed with its attempts
starting over. A command whose handler is still running SHALL NOT be handed over again, however long
it runs, and a resumed command SHALL keep the order of the aggregate it names whatever protection its
payload carries. Heavy commands SHALL be exempt from both order promises, and a heavy command SHALL
NOT hold back a command or a resumption that follows it. Recorded commands SHALL be resumed by the
execution model's drain wherever that drain runs, whichever host dispatched them, and SHALL never be
published to a message bus.

Every command on this path SHALL pass through the same mediator pipeline — validation, authorization,
tenant isolation, audit — as a command on the bus path, and an enqueue-time authorization the host
registered SHALL apply whatever order it and the execution model were registered in.

#### Scenario: The host dies after acceptance

- **WHEN** the dispatch has returned and the host is killed before the handler ran
- **THEN** the command runs after the host or another silo resumes it — verified with twenty kills
  on the PostgreSQL store

#### Scenario: The host dies after the handler completed

- **WHEN** the handler completed and the host is killed before the completion was recorded
- **THEN** the command runs a second time, which the handler tolerates as it does under at-least-once
  delivery on the bus

#### Scenario: A handler keeps failing

- **WHEN** a resumed command's handler throws on every attempt
- **THEN** it is resumed up to the configured bound, then kept with the attempt count and the last
  failure, and the commands after it are still resumed

#### Scenario: An operator returns a kept command

- **WHEN** an operator returns a kept command through the documented procedure
- **THEN** it is resumed with its attempt count starting over

#### Scenario: A handler runs longer than the grace

- **WHEN** a recorded command's handler is still running after the grace has passed
- **THEN** it is not handed over again while it runs, and it runs once

#### Scenario: A resumed command's payload is encrypted

- **WHEN** a command whose payload is encrypted is resumed after a crash
- **THEN** it runs in the activation of the aggregate it names, after the commands before it

#### Scenario: A command the host's pipeline rejects is dispatched

- **WHEN** a command that the host's validation or authorization rejects is dispatched on this path
- **THEN** it is rejected as it would be on the bus path, and its handler does not run

#### Scenario: Enqueue-time authorization is registered after the execution model

- **WHEN** a host registers enqueue-time authorization before or after the execution model's dispatcher
- **THEN** an unauthorised dispatch is refused and an authorised one reaches its activation, in both
  orders

#### Scenario: Two commands to one aggregate from one scope

- **WHEN** one scope dispatches two commands naming the same aggregate, one after the other
- **THEN** they run in the order they were dispatched; across scopes no order is promised, and a
  heavy command keeps no order with the commands around it

#### Scenario: The drain runs on a silo that did not dispatch the commands

- **WHEN** commands are recorded by an API host and the drain runs on a silo where the execution
  model's dispatcher is not registered, and a recorded command is due or kept
- **THEN** the due command is resumed within its attempt bound, the kept command stays kept, and
  neither is published to a bus

#### Scenario: Two heavy commands to one aggregate are due

- **WHEN** two heavy commands naming the same aggregate are due in one resumption, and further
  commands are due after them
- **THEN** every due command is handed over without waiting for either heavy command to finish

### Requirement: Work that must happen once happens once per cluster

Singleton work SHALL run in one place in the cluster at its period, without a lock, only on a silo
that registered it, and SHALL resume elsewhere when the silo running it is lost. Owner-checked durable
timers SHALL fire once per cluster on or after their due time, SHALL fire for an owner that exists and
never for one that was removed, and SHALL survive a restart of the silo that registered them. A timer
SHALL NOT fire a further period late because the clocks of the silos differ slightly. A process
timeout registered in a step SHALL survive a kill at any point of that step, and a timeout whose
handling cancels or registers the process's timers SHALL complete.

#### Scenario: Two silos run the same singleton work

- **WHEN** two silos register the same singleton work
- **THEN** it runs once per period in the cluster, not once per silo

#### Scenario: A timer's owner was removed before it was due

- **WHEN** a timer is due and its owner no longer exists
- **THEN** the timer unregisters itself and no handler runs

#### Scenario: The silo is killed with timers open

- **WHEN** a silo is killed with registered timers and restarted
- **THEN** every kept owner's timer fires exactly once and no removed owner's timer fires — verified
  with ten kills on the PostgreSQL reminder table

#### Scenario: Silos register different singleton work

- **WHEN** one silo registers a singleton work and another silo of the cluster does not
- **THEN** the work runs on the silo that registered it, and the other silo reports no failure for it

#### Scenario: The silo running singleton work is lost

- **WHEN** the silo running a singleton work is killed while another silo that registered it stays
- **THEN** the work runs on the remaining silo at its period

#### Scenario: A timeout changes the process's timers

- **WHEN** a process handles a timeout by cancelling or registering timers, or a fact for the process
  arrives while its timeout is being handled
- **THEN** the handling completes and the timeout does not run again

#### Scenario: The host dies inside a step that schedules a timeout

- **WHEN** a silo is killed at any point of a step that schedules a timeout, and the fact is applied
  again after the restart
- **THEN** the timeout fires once, and a timeout for a step whose events were never recorded reaches the
  process with the state as recorded

#### Scenario: A tick arrives shortly before the due time

- **WHEN** a timer's tick runs on a silo whose clock is slightly behind the registering host's
- **THEN** the timer fires on that tick and not a retry period later

#### Scenario: A timer's handler runs longer than the retry period

- **WHEN** a timer's handler is still running when the timer's next tick arrives
- **THEN** the tick does not start the handler again, and the handler runs once
